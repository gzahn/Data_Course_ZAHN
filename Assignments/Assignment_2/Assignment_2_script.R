# Assignment 2 (G. Zahn)


# Task 4 : find the csv files and save as an object
csv_files <- list.files(path = "Data",pattern = ".csv",recursive = TRUE)


# Task 5 : how many files match?

# Task 6:
# Open the wingspan_vs_mass.csv file and store the contents as an R object named “df” using the read.csv() function
list.files(pattern = "wingspan_vs_mass.csv",recursive = TRUE)
df <- read.csv(list.files(pattern = "wingspan_vs_mass.csv",recursive = TRUE))

# Task 7:
# Inspect the first 5 lines of this data set using the head() function

# Task 8:
# Find any files (recursively) in the Data/ directory that begin with the letter “b” (lowercase)
list.files(path = "Data",pattern = "^b",recursive = TRUE)

# Task 9:
# Write a command that displays the first line of each of those “b” files (this is tricky… use a for-loop)
