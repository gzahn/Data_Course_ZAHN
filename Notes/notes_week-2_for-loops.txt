A for-loop can iterate through a series of values and perform the same action on each value.

This could be a list of file names, or a series of numbers, or any values really.

It takes a mutable variable and assignes it the first value in the series, then when it loops back through, that variable will take the second value, etc.

In R, it can look like:

for(i in mylistofvalues){
x <- some_function(i)
return(x)
}
